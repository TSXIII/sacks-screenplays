        <p>Now that you know the correct way to structure a plot, let's discuss <b>formatting a script</b>. A screenplay's actual content will vary based on one's writing style and story, but there are specific terms authors use to correctly articulate their ideas:</p>

        <p>This may seem like a lot to digest, but remember these terms need only appear in a script as they are needed. The idea is to clearly and concisely communicate a scene's flow to those who look at your screenplay.</p>
        <p>When writing your script, make sure you start each scene with a heading that includes "INT." or "EXT." and is followed by the respective location and time of day in which it takes place. After your heading, place any action (descriptions of what a character sees, hears, or does) or dialogue (what a character says). When introducing a character for the first time, write his/her name in capital letters. If you envision a scene ending a particular way, such as jumping to another place or simply changing to the next scene via a dissolve, indicate this on the right side of the page. Make sure you only write what the audience can see or hear when watching a finished film; there is no need to describe a character's feelings since this is implied through visible emotion and vocal tone onscreen.</p>
