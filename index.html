    <div class="pbox">
        <p>Regardless of genre, every movie made in Hollywood begins the same way: as a document called a <b>screenplay</b>. What <i>is</i> a screenplay, you ask? It is a scene-by-scene breakdown of all the dialogue and action sequences a filmmaker must shoot to tell his or her story. A screenplay is often what convinces studio executives to greenlight a piece of cinema for production.</p>
